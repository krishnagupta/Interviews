1. Pro's & Con's of SPA ?
=> From a technical perspective, both SPAs and MPAs are constantly loading the data from servers. However,  
in single page applications, the higher speed and efficiency is achieved with the help of JSON. 
Having SPAs doesnâ€™t necessarily mean simultaneous HTML and data loading. More often, the main data are
downloaded after the initial loading of HTML, CSS and JS.
Advantages :-
1. Quick loading time
2. Seamless user experience
3. Enables ease in building feature-rich applications
4. Uses less Bandwidth
From a technical perspective, there are 3 main SPA disadvantages:
1) It is much more difficult to implement SEO techniques on SPA.
2) Use a lot of browser resources.
3) With large JS data volume, the pages download can be low-speed which significantly hurts the user experience.
