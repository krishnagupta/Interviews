1. Why do we need Redux when we already have Context API ?
=> for low-frequency updates like locale, theme changes, user authentication, etc. 
the React Context is perfectly fine. But with a more complex state which has high-frequency updates, the React Context 
won't be a good solution. Because, the React Context will trigger a re-render on each update, and optimizing it manually 
can be really tough.And there, a solution like Redux is much easier to implement.
